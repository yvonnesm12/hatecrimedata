        <p>NEW YORK, NY — Over the last five years, hate crimes against Jewish people have been consistently the top bias-motivated crime in New York City, according to data collected by the NYPD. </p>

<p>A total of 873 antisemitic hate crimes have been reported since 2017, the highest out of any group. The second-highest total of hate crimes is aimed at gay men with 217. </p>


  <p>James Mulvaney, professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, was appointed deputy commissioner of the Division of Human Rights by Gov. David Paterson, where he worked with police departments across New York on identifying hate crimes. During his time as deputy commissioner, he noticed there was an uptick in hate crime reports after the appearance of public service ads that explained what a hate crime was and how to report them. </p>

  <p>“You could chart it on the nose to the appearance of the public service ads,” Mulvaney said. “So was hate crime up or was the reporting of hate crime up? I would say that a lot of it was the reporting was up.”</p>

          <p> Mulvaney says reporting of hate crimes ebbs and flows, which may or may not indicate an uptick in hate crimes. However, he does say that over the last five years, there has been a general increase of hate crimes “as the tenor of political discourse has become so overcharged and hateful.” From his experience in the field, he’s noticed “there has been a certain acceptance of airing and acting on bias that perhaps was not as overt as it was before the inauguration of Donald Trump.”
          </p>

          <p>“He came in and he made it okay to pick on women and to disparage people because of their national origin, especially non-white people,” Mulvaney said. “And then all of a sudden, it became almost acceptable behavior. Once you create this climate where bias is acceptable, people are going to express that in ways that they shouldn't.” </p>
